# Python-based Timing Analysis Project

This project provides a Python script for timing analysis, which is designed to process the timing reports generated by the PT tool after circuit synthesis. The script uses a tree data structure to model the circuit.

After processing the timing report, the script is capable of producing a tree diagram that depicts the distribution of critical paths, along with various statistical charts. This enables quick and visual analysis of circuit timing.

## Inputs

The input to this script is the timing report produced by the PT tool after synthesizing the circuit.

## Outputs

The outputs are a tree diagram showing the distribution of critical paths, and various statistical charts.

## Usage

This tool is designed for those who need a quick and visual method to analyze the timing of circuits. Whether you're a circuit designer looking to improve the performance of your circuits, or a student studying circuit design, this tool can be of great help.
